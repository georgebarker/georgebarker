# My open source projects
I invite you take a look at my open source, public projects.  
  Here, you can get a feel of what problems I an interested in solving, and what technologies I use to solve them.
## [REST WordReference API](https://github.com/georgebarker/rest-wordreference-api) 🗣️
 A REST API wrapper of [WordReference.com](https://wordreference.com) using Express and Docker so that it can be deployed in the cloud and used by any client, rather than being bound to using the JavaScript API. 

## [UK Train Station Finder](https://github.com/georgebarker/StationServer) 🚉
A Java web service to find the nearest UK train stations to your location.  
  This app demonstrates some primitive, raw Java techniques, such as using the native `java.sql.*` package for database interaction, `com.sun.net.httpserver.*` package for the web services, and self-managed dependency injection, showing what can still be achieved in plain, old Java.
