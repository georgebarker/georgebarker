# A selection of my open source projects
I invite you take a look at my open source, public projects.  
  Here, you can get a feel of what problems I an interested in solving, and what technologies I use to solve them.
  
## [Cryptocurrency WebSocket Server 🤑](https://github.com/georgebarker/crypto-websocket-server)
A Java application running on Tomcat that pushes the live prices for cryptocurrencies to clients listening on a WebSocket.

## [Cryptocurrency WebSocket iOS Client 🤑📱](https://github.com/georgebarker/ios-crypto-websocket-client)
An iOS app in SwiftUI using WebSockets to provide live prices for cryptocurrencies in a list and detailed view.

## [REST WordReference API 🗣️](https://github.com/georgebarker/rest-wordreference-api)
 A REST API wrapper of [WordReference.com](https://wordreference.com) using Express and Docker so that it can be deployed in the cloud and used by any client, rather than being bound to using the JavaScript API. 

## [UK Train Station Finder 🚉](https://github.com/georgebarker/StationServer)
A Java web service to find the nearest UK train stations to your location.  
  This app demonstrates some primitive, raw Java techniques, such as using the native `java.sql.*` package for database interaction, `com.sun.net.httpserver.*` package for the web services, and self-managed dependency injection, showing what can still be achieved in plain, old Java.
